To be honest, There is no environmental pollutions or problems that I can change by myself.
Everyday environmental cleaners come and clean and collect recyclable garbage between 6:00 and 8:00 every night.

So, I decided to find out what I could do.
(As I decided a plan, I will update the Calendar)
First of all, I think it will be a small but big influence to raise personal habits that are separate wastage required by the community.
It would be a great basic behavior.
On every Saturday, after schedules, I will pick up some trashes around my community. And I will increase the area gradually.

Also, even if we change a little in our lives, there are many things that change a lot.
For example, you can decrease waste by either reducing the amount of plastic used, or reducing the amount of styrofoam used, or reducing the use of disposable products.
Of course, the separate collection can reduce environmental pollution, but if you reduce usage and emissions themselves, there is no problem.
We will make posters to tell the community about these contents.
The main content is to reduce disposable items and to reduce environmental pollution by reducing the number of pollutants emitted.
I will print the poster in a proper amount, and put in a mailbox around the community. And people will be able to see my poster.
